The threshold dynamics is explored for the case of relatively small noise. Our results show that large noise will cause the elimination of the disease, which will help suppress the spread of the disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Media coverage is one of the important measures for controlling infectious diseases, but the effect of media coverage on diseases spreading in a stochastic environment still needs to be further investigated. Here, we present a stochastic susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) epidemic model incorporating media coverage and environmental fluctuations. By using Feller's test and stochastic comparison principle, we establish the stochastic basic reproduction number R0s, which completely determines whether the disease is persistent or not in the population. If R0s≤1, the disease will go to extinction; if R0s=1, the disease will also go to extinction in probability, which has not been reported in the known literatures; and if R0s{\textgreater}1, the disease will be stochastically persistent. In addition, the existence of the stationary distribution of the model and its ergodicity are obtained. Numerical simulations based on real examples support the theoretical results. The interesting findings are that (i) the environmental fluctuation may significantly affect the threshold dynamical behavior of the disease and the fluctuations in different size scale population, and (ii) the media coverage plays an important role in affecting the stationary distribution of disease under a low intensity noise environment.},

@article{Allen2012,
abstract = {The basic reproduction number, ℛ(0), one of the most well-known thresholds in deterministic epidemic theory, predicts a disease outbreak if ℛ(0){\textgreater}1. In stochastic epidemic theory, there are also thresholds that predict a major outbreak. In the case of a single infectious group, if ℛ(0){\textgreater}1 and i infectious individuals are introduced into a susceptible population, then the probability of a major outbreak is approximately 1-(1/ℛ(0))( i ). With multiple infectious groups from which the disease could emerge, this result no longer holds. Stochastic thresholds for multiple groups depend on the number of individuals within each group, i ( j ), j=1, {\ldots}, n, and on the probability of disease extinction for each group, q ( j ). It follows from multitype branching processes that the probability of a major outbreak is approximately [Formula: see text]. In this investigation, we summarize some of the deterministic and stochastic threshold theory, illustrate how to calculate the stochastic thresholds, and derive some new relationships between the deterministic and stochastic thresholds.},

abstract = {A series of films focused on movement education and rhythm training in string playing with emphasis on the violin were developed. An introductory film deals with principles of movement in string playing. Fifteen additional titles offer guidance to the student and teacher in the various details of basic string instruction. A summary film presents a final report on the performance and progress of children trained in the Project at the end of formal instruction. The central issue of the project under test was the hypothesis that movement training, designed to free the student from excessive tensions, can be introduced within an organized plan of string instruction, and that such a plan, in the long run, will result in faster learning and better playing in all facets of instruction. The materials were used and tested in an extensive two-year trial, involving 22 teaching centers in Illinois and additional out-of-state testing centers. Products of the study include: a film series in color on "The Teaching of Action in String Playing"; an introductory film and other films; a tune record and three exercise records. Recommendations include: (1) Teacher-training institutions hold the key to the future of string instruction in the schools; and (2) Programmed teaching materials and the use of audio-visual aids point to a new era of efficient instruction of string instruments.

The stochastic model is based on an existing deterministic metapopulation tick-borne disease model. We compare the disease dynamics of the deterministic and stochastic models in order to determine the effect of randomness in tick-borne disease dynamics. The probability of disease extinction and that of a major outbreak are computed and approximated using the multitype Galton-Watson branching process and numerical simulations, respectively. Analytical and numerical results show some significant differences in model predictions between the stochastic and deterministic models. In particular, we find that a disease outbreak is more likely if the disease is introduced by infected deer as opposed to infected ticks. These insights demonstrate the importance of host movement in the expansion of tick-borne diseases into new geographic areas.},

We define two threshold parameters, the stochastic demographic reproduction number Rdsand the stochastic basic reproduction number R0s, to utilize in identifying the stochastic extinction and persistence of the disease. We find that the stochastic disease dynamics can be determined by the environment fluctuations which measured by the intensity of volatility and the speed of reversion: the larger intensity of volatility or the smaller speed of reversion can suppress the outbreak of the disease, the smaller intensity of volatility or the the higher speed of reversion can enhance the outbreak of the disease. Furthermore, via numerical simulations, we find that the stochastic model has an endemic stationary distribution which leads to the stochastic persistence of the disease. Our results show that mean-reverting process is a well-established way of introducing stochastic environmental noise into biologically realistic population dynamic models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extend a classical SIRS epidemic model with the infectious forces under intervention strategies from a deterministic framework to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) one through introducing random fluctuations. The value of our study lies in two aspects. Mathematically, by using the Markov semigroups theory, we prove that the reproduction number R0S can be used to govern the stochastic dynamics of SDE model. If R0S{\textless}1, under mild extra conditions, the SDE system has a disease-free absorbing set which means the extinction of disease with probability one. If R0S{\textgreater}1, under mild extra conditions, it has an endemic stationary distribution which leads to the stochastical persistence of the disease. Epidemiologically, we find that random fluctuations can suppress disease outbreak, which can provide us some useful control strategies to regulate disease dynamics.},

Through relations between branching process theory and the corresponding deterministic model, it is shown that the deterministic and stochastic thresholds are in agreement for discrete-time and continuous-time infectious disease models with multiple infectious groups. Branching process theory can be applied in conjunction with the deterministic model to give additional information about disease extinction. These relations are illustrated, analytically and numerically, in two settings, a general stage-structured model and a vector-host model applied to West Nile virus in mosquitoes and birds. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
