abstract = {The present work is devoted to study the asymptotic nature of a stochastic pine wilt disease model. Investigating the basic reproductive number, we proved that it has sharp threshold properties. The underlying system of stochastic differential equations is analyzed, and proper Lyapunov functionals are formulated to show the stability analysis. Adequate conditions are provided to study the extinction and permanence of the disease. Reducing infected individuals involved in a substance abuse is a challenging task therefore, using some control variables the stochastic optimality system, is obtained. Furthermore, for the authenticity of the obtained results numerical simulations are carried out at the end of the manuscript.},

abstract = {We have developed a generic modelling framework to understand the dynamics of foliar pathogen and biocontrol agent (BCA) populations in order to predict the likelihood of successful biocontrol in relation to the mechanisms involved. The model considers biocontrol systems for foliar pathogens only and, although it is most applicable to fungal BCA systems, does not address a specific biocontrol system. Four biocontrol mechanisms (competition, antibiosis, mycoparasitism and induced resistance) were included within the model rubric. Because of the wide range of mechanisms involved we use Trichoderma/Botrytis as an exemplar system. Qualitative analysis of the model showed that the rates of a BCA colonising diseased and/or healthy plant tissues and the time that the BCA remains active are two of the more important factors in determining the final outcome of a biocontrol system. Further evaluation of the model indicated that the dynamic path to the steady-state population levels also depends critically on other parameters such as the host-pathogen infection rate. In principle, the model can be extended to include other potential mechanisms, including spatio-temporal heterogeneity, fungicide effects, non-fungal BCA and strategies for BCA application, although with a cost in model tractability and ease of interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) has been considered as a serious pest in all of tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. B. tabaci first recorded as early as in 1940s in China and has been reported as a pest of various crops in 22 provinces or cities. But only recently it has become a severe problem for vegetable and ornamental crops in Guangdong and Beijing. In China B. tabaci is known to transmit at least 5 plant viruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl virus (TomLCV), squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV-C). So far, approximately 18 parasitoids, 17 predators and 1 pathogenic fungus were recorded in China. This paper presents an overview of B. tabaci as a pest and virus vector in China, with special attention given to non-chemical control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley. All rights reserved.},

ToLCV was detected in six of the 10 group samples of field collected B. tabaci. ToLCV was also identified in 13 weed species commonly found in Karnataka, both by symptom expression and TAS-ELISA. ToLCV from c. 61{\%} of infected plants was transmitted successfully to tomato by B. tabaci. Tomato plots were planted at three locations on the University of Agricultural Sciences Campus, Bangalore. Indian tomato leaf curl virus disease (ToLCVD) incidence increased most rapidly when the tomato plot was situated adjacent to an older ToLCVD-infected tomato field. When the plots were positioned in a dryland or a wetland area, at least 500 m away from any infected tomato fields, the ToLCVD incidence increased less rapidly, although in all sites it was 100{\%} by 11 wk after transplanting. The numbers of B. tabaci caught on yellow traps in all sites increased during weeks 1-3 after transplanting and thereafter remained at between 10-15 adults trap-1 24 h-1. Adult numbers recorded on tomato plants by direct counts remained approximately constant at 2-4 adults plant. Tomato fields were planted in three taluks (administrative areas) of Karnataka, that had different current and previous histories of tomato production. ToLCVD incidence increased most and least rapidly, respectively, in Kolar taluk where tomato is grown continuously and Doddaballapur tuluk where tomato was grown in the area for the first time. In Malur tuluk, where tomato was grown discontinuously (once a year), the incidence of ToLCVD increased at an intermediate rate. Weed host-plant species growing near the experimental sites had averages of between 1.5-10.0 B. tabaci nymphs per plant, whereas the tomato plants had only 0.3 nymphs per plant.

abstract = {Plant viruses are an important constraint to crop production worldwide. Rarely have plant virologists, vector entomologists and crop specialists worked together in search of sustainable management practices for viral diseases. Historically, modelling approaches have been vector-based dealing with empirical forecasting systems or simulation of vector population dynamics. More recently, epidemiological models, such as those used in human/animal epidemiology, have been introduced in an attempt to characterize and analyse the population ecology of viral diseases. The theoretical bases for these models and their use in evaluating control strategies in terms of the interactions between host, virus and vector are considered here. Vector activity and behaviour, especially in relation to virus transmission, are important determinants of the rate and extent of epidemic development. The applicability and flexibility of these models are illustrated by reference to specific case studies, including the increasing importance of whitefly-transmitted viruses. Some outstanding research and methodological issues are considered.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The infectivity period of infected individuals can be influenced dynamically by a decision maker, with the aim to minimize the expected aggregated economic costs due to illness and drug treatment. This stochastic control problem is investigated under two alternative assumptions about the information available. If a complete and exact measurement of the size of the infected population is available at any time, then the optimal control is sought in a state-feedback form and the related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation can be used. If no state measurement is available, then the optimal control is sought in an open-loop form and the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem for the Kolmogorov forward equation. In both cases, deriving optimality conditions requires non-standard arguments due to the degeneracy of the involved HJB and Kolmogorov equations. Based on the obtained theoretical results, the role of the information pattern is numerically investigated.},

abstract = {1. A number of insect vectors of plant-virus diseases make only transitory visits to the crop in which the economic effects of the disease are important. The incidence of disease in the crop depends primarily on the immigration of vectors from alternative hosts which act as a reservoir of both the virus and vector. 2. An epidemiological model was developed to represent this situation and parameters were estimated for the case of tomato leaf curl virus disease (TLCVD) (Geminiviridae, Subgroup III) in India. From an analysis of the model, the following possibilities for the management of TLCVD emerged. 3. It was clear that varietal resistance to infection could be an important component of disease management but whether, once infected, the tomato plants acted as a source of inoculum had little impact on disease incidence in the tomato crop. 4. A very low rate of simulated vector immigration into a tomato crop sufficed to cause almost total infection. Around Bangalore, vectors may migrate into tomato crops in numbers in excess of those required for disease 'saturation', explaining why, using conventional insecticides, very efficient and intensive vector control is currently required to reduce disease incidence. 5. Disease incidence was sensitive to vector mortality only when vector numbers were low. In most cases, the immigration of viruliferous vectors made disease incidence insensitive to the mortality of vectors within the tomato crop. 6. A strategy for disease management which targets more than one of the parameters to which the model proved most sensitive is likely to be necessary. In particular, the use of protective netting combined with the growing of resistant varieties has the potential to reduce both B. tabaci immigration to the crop and to reduce virus inoculation by those insects which do reach the crop.},

abstract = {This primer article focuses on the basic reproduction number, ℛ0, for infectious diseases, and other reproduction numbers related to ℛ0 that are useful in guiding control strategies. Beginning with a simple population model, the concept is developed for a threshold value of ℛ0 determining whether or not the disease dies out. The next generation matrix method of calculating ℛ0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are defined, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate ℛ0 are given. These are useful for more complicated models that, for example, take account of variations in environmental fluctuation or stochasticity.},

abstract = {1. The dynamics of a virus disease in a perennial plant population are modelled. The population is divided into healthy, latently infected, infectious and post-infectious plants and linked differential equations describe the dynamics of each category. 2. Qualitative analysis of this model shows stable dynamics and threshold conditions for disease persistence. Stable equilibria are reached after several years. The dynamics of the model are highly sensitive to changes in contact rate and infectious period. 3. Disease management by roguing (removal) of infected plants and replanting with healthy ones is investigated. Roguing only in the post-infectious category confers no advantage. At low contact rates, roguing only when plants become infectious is sufficient to eradicate the disease. At high contact rates, roguing latently infected as well as infectious plants is advisable. 4. With disease present the equilibrium level of healthy plants does not depend on replanting rate, but at higher replanting rates the disease is more difficult to eradicate. There is a trade-off between roguing and replanting in designing optimal disease management strategies. 5. Using parameter values estimated from field studies on three plant virus diseases, the model indicates that eradication is achievable with realistic roguing intensities.},

B. tabaci first recorded as early as in 1940s in China and has been reported as a pest of various crops in 22 provinces or cities. But only recently it has become a severe problem for vegetable and ornamental crops in Guangdong and Beijing. In China B. tabaci is known to transmit at least 5 plant viruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl virus (TomLCV), squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV-C). So far, approximately 18 parasitoids, 17 predators and 1 pathogenic fungus were recorded in China. This paper presents an overview of B. tabaci as a pest and virus vector in China, with special attention given to non-chemical control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vector-transmitted diseases of plants have had devastating effects on agricultural production worldwide, resulting in drastic reductions in yield for crops such as cotton, soybean, tomato, and cassava. Plant-vector-virus models with continuous replanting are investigated in terms of the effects of selection of cuttings, roguing, and insecticide use on disease prevalence in plants. Previous models are extended to include two replanting strategies: frequencyreplanting and abundance-replanting. In frequency-replanting, replanting of infected cuttings depends on the selection frequency parameter $\epsilon$, whereas in abundance-replanting, replanting depends on plant abundance via a selection rate parameter also denoted as $\epsilon$. The two models are analysed and new thresholds for disease elimination are defined for each model. Parameter values for cassava, whiteflies, and African cassava mosaic virus serve as a case study. A numerical sensitivity analysis illustrates how the equilibrium densities of healthy and infected plants vary with parameter values. Optimal control theory is used to investigate the effects of roguing and insecticide use with a goal of maximizing the healthy plants that are harvested. Differences in the control strategies in the two models are seen for large values of $\epsilon$. Also, the combined strategy of roguing and insecticide use performs better than a single control.},

In addition, the authors introduce the optimal control of discrete systems and of partial differential equations (PDEs). Featuring a user-friendly interface, the book contains fourteen interactive sections of various applications, including immunology and epidemic disease models, management decisions in harvesting, and resource allocation models. It also develops the underlying numerical methods of the applications and includes the MATLAB{\textregistered} codes on which the applications are based.Requiring only basic knowledge of multivariable calculus, simple ODEs, and mathematical models, this text shows how to adjust controls in biological systems in order to achieve proper outcomes.},

abstract = {Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) has emerged as a serious threat to food security in sub-Saharan Africa. MLN is caused by coinfection with two viruses, Maize chlorotic mottle virus and a potyvirus, often Sugarcane mosaic virus. To better understand the dynamics of MLN and to provide insight into disease management, we modeled the spread of the viruses causing MLN within and between growing seasons. The model allows for transmission via vectors, soil, and seed, as well as exogenous sources of infection. Following model parameterization, we predict how management affects disease prevalence and crop performance over multiple seasons. Resource-rich farmers with large holdings can achieve good control by combining clean seed and insect control. However, crop rotation is often required to effect full control. Resource-poor farmers with smaller holdings must rely on rotation and roguing, and achieve more limited control. For both types of farmer, unless management is synchronized over large areas, exogenous sources of infection can thwart control. As well as providing practical guidance, our modeling framework is potentially informative for other cropping systems in which coinfection has devastating effects. Our work also emphasizes how mathematical modeling can inform management of an emerging disease even when epidemiological information remains scanty.},

The purpose was to reveal differences in residual efficacy of four materials that are nearing registration for use on tomato-cyazypyr, flupyradifurone, pyrafluquinazon, and sulfoxaflor-and to compare them with two established insecticides, pymetrozine and a zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin combination. Differences in efficacy were expected because these six materials represent five distinct modes of action and both contact and systemic materials. Percentage of tomato seedlings expressing virus symptoms tended to be lowest in seedlings treated with flupyradifurone. The zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin insecticide demonstrated comparable efficacy to flupyradifurone in some trials at 3 and 7 d after treatment inoculations, but not the 14 d after treatment inoculation. Pyrafluquinazon was not statistically different from cyazypyr or sulfoxaflor in percentage of plants with virus symptoms in any trial. Percentage virus in the cyazypyr and sulfoxaflor treatments was not statistically different in the 3 and 7 d after treatment inoculations. Among seedlings treated with insecticide, percentage with virus symptoms tended to be highest in the seedlings treated with pymetrozine.},

abstract = {Plant viruses are an important constraint to crop production worldwide. Rarely have plant virologists, vector entomologists and crop specialists worked together in search of sustainable management practices for viral diseases. Historically, modelling approaches have been vector-based dealing with empirical forecasting systems or simulation of vector population dynamics. More recently, epidemiological models, such as those used in human/animal epidemiology, have been introduced in an attempt to characterize and analyse the population ecology of viral diseases. The theoretical bases for these models and their use in evaluating control strategies in terms of the interactions between host, virus and vector are considered here. Vector activity and behaviour, especially in relation to virus transmission, are important determinants of the rate and extent of epidemic development. The applicability and flexibility of these models are illustrated by reference to specific case studies, including the increasing importance of whitefly-transmitted viruses. Some outstanding research and methodological issues are considered.},

abstract = {A dynamic cropping system was represented by a square lattice of fields in which crops were successively harvested and replanted. A spectrum of crop ages existed at any one time and the virus disease persisted by spread of inoculum between crops. Such a situation is typical of many areas of tropical irrigated rice cultivation in which rice tungro virus disease (RTVD) occurs. Using a mathematical model of the epidemiology of RTVD in the cropping system, the deployment of fields of a genotype expressing some resistance to the disease was investigated. Previous studies on the effect of genotype mixtures on disease progress within a single crop have shown that both the rate of disease increase and the rate of focus expansion were proportional to the logarithm of the fraction of susceptible plants in the mixture. Here, looking at long-term disease incidence in a dynamic cropping system, it was found that this same 'logarithmic rule' applied, provided that resistant crop deployment was spatially random. A relatively large proportion of fields had to be planted with resistant varieties in order to have sufficient area-wide impact on inoculum to reduce disease incidence in fields of susceptible varieties. In many rice cropping systems there are two growing seasons per year and the modelling indicated that the best strategy was to concentrate deployment of resistant varieties in the season of greatest disease spread. Attempts to minimize inoculum carry-over to the 'high spread' season by concentrating resistant varieties in the previous season had little effect over a range of simulated conditions. In considering recommendations for the management of RTVD, a conflict existed between the reduction of disease incidence strategically and in the individual fields of a newly deployed variety. To maximize area-wide strategic impact, small genotype units and random patterns were best, but to protect individual fields, large units and concentrated deployment were best.},
